# Tableau
Using global health data downloaded in Excel, provide various health comparison visualisations of this data by different categories in Tableau.

The health data represents the various health biometrics for most countries around the world, covering issues such as cancer rates, life expectancies, blood pressure rates, population growth, etc, all tracked every year from 1990 through to 2008.

## Analysis

Using the Source Health Data, I produced some graphics in Tableau that showed the following:
1. Average life expectancy vs gender by continent
2. Average BMI vs Average life expectancy
3. Average blood pressure by country

For each category, the visualistions of this data shows you at a glance, so you can easily see the bigger picture and more easily see the visual representation of what each analysis represents in terms of comparisons instead of having to trawl through hundreds or thousands of lines of raw data.
